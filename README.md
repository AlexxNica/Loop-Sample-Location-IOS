# Loop iOS Sample - Locations

## Prerequisites:
* You will need the latest version of XCode (7.3.1) to run this sample app.
* You will need to install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

These instructions will get you a copy of a Loop Location sample app for viewing locations computed by the Loop platform.

0. If you havenâ€™t already, signup for a Loop account at the [Loop Developer Site](http://www.loop.ms)
0. Create an app to get your Loop app id and app token
0. Clone this sample app `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Loop-Sample-Location-IOS.git`), and open it in XCode.
0. Make a copy of `Config/Keys.example.xcconfig` and call it `Config/Keys.xcconfig`
0. Replace the `YOUR_APP_ID` and `YOUR_APP_TOKEN` constant in `AppDelegate.swift` with your loop app key and secret token. 
0. In the keys config file provide values for the `LOOP_APP_ID_PROP` and `LOOP_APP_TOKEN_PROP` using your loop app id and app token from the dashboard.
0. From the command line in the project directory run `carthage update --platform iOS`
0. Run the app. 

After this is done, you will be able to see known locations after they are generated by the Loop sample app and processed by the Loop platform.
